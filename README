Allocator version 0.01
======================

A DBIx::Class component that gives ResultSets the ability to allocate blocks of
auto-increment ids from the database.  This is useful for creating id pools that
an application can reserve and use without having to be connected (through a web
interface) to the database (e.g. mobile apps that might not always have network
connectivity).
